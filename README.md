# KWK User Inyerface

As an Instructor Assistant at Kode with Klossy, I have often drawn upon Bagaar's [User Inyerface Worst-Practice UI/UX example](https://userinyerface.com/) to demonstrate what _not_ to do when it comes to user design. However, teaching the Mobile Application curriculum with Swift & Xcode, it felt like a departure from our regular coding environment to use a website instead of an iOS app. Thus, I decided to translate Bagaar's excellent yet painfully aggravating design into iOS, incorporating similar frustrations and a painful UI into this app. Not only does it show what *not* to do from a design perspective, but this app also demonstrates how to implement some *spicy* features many scholars might want to incorporate in their final projects! These are outlined in the **Features** section below :)

## Features
### ActivityViewController (aka a share menu!)
check out the YouWinViewController!
### dismissing keyboard on tap
check out the SignUpViewController!
### UIAlertController (showing an alert popup)
check out the SignUp ViewController!
### WKWebView
check out the SignUp ViewController!
### Dates & Time Deltas

### Extensions

### Adding Gifs
check out the Gif UIImageView extension in the Extensions file and the YouWinViewController implementation!
### Core Data
check out the PreviousAttempts & YouWin View Controllers!
### deleting from a UITableViewController on swipe
check out the PreviousAttemptsViewController!
### programmatic & full-screen segues
check out the SignUpViewController!
### RegEx string validation (for email/passwords)
check out the SignUpViewController!
### GestureHandlers (to allow for swiping out of a "show" segue)
check out the TermsAndConditionsViewController!
### global variables
check out the GlobalVariables file!
